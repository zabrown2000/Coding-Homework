The state of the game is represented by a list of 7 items:
0. The game board - a matrix (list of lists) of ints. Empty cells = 0,

1. Row position of current player
2. Column position of current player
3. Value of current square
4. First player of game (first player moves in rows, second moves in columns)
5. Who's turn is it: HUMAN or COMPUTER 
6. Computer's score
7. Human's score
